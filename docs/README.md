### Colour Scheme

+ #2A4A56
+ #5F7D89
+ #3F6270
+ #193C4A
+ #092833

I felt like this colour choice was a good choice because blue is considered

### Typography

I will be using Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif in that order of priority. I will be using Arial because it is easy to read, versatile because of the various weights it has, making it more accessible, meeting requirements, and because it is a web safe font meaning it comes pre installed on machines. Helvetica is the second priority because it is similar to Arial, It is easy to read and versatile, and it is a web safe font. Sans-serif also has the same advantages to Areal and Helvetica.

## Storyboards

### Company Profile alternative Design

### Company Profile Design

![Storyboard for Company Profile](../assets/img/CompProf.png)

#### A Bootstrap Navbar

+ #092833
+ Width 100% Height 56 pixels
+ White text, weight 700
+ Will have the companies name, links to other pages and a search bar and button.
+ Bootstraps navbar automatically adjusts its size and layout for smaller screens.

#### B Bootstrap grid column

+ #5F7D89
+ <h1> are #ffffff, and use default weights and sizes.
+ Size: At and above the bootstrap breakpoint xl it is 8 of 12 columns in width, when it goes below xl it is 12 columns in width. Height 100%.
Paragraphs


#### C Bootstrap grid column

+ Size: At and above the bootstrap breakpoint xl it is 4 of 12 columns in width, when it goes below xl it is 12 columns in width.
+ #3F6270
+ white text, heading 1 use default weights and sizes.
+ Height 100%

#### D Text

+ white text, default heading weights and sizes. Paragraphs and list items text changes size depending on screen size, if the screen is 1200px of below the text is 14px, if it is above that it is 17px.

#### E Text

+ white text, default heading weights and sizes. Paragraphs and list items text changes size depending on screen size, if the screen is 1200px of below the text is 14px, if it is above that it is 17px.

All text will be in the Arial font and should it not be available then Helvetica, or sans-serif fonts.

I decided to go with design two for my website because for the first design I would have had to create a separate page for the staff according to client requirements. I also like this design because the added navigation capabilities like the search bar, which would make the site easier to navigate.

### Selected Company Profile Mobile

### Join us/Job Spec Page First Design

![Alt text](../assets/img/JBSpec.png)

### Join us/Job Spec Page Alternative Design

![Alt text](../assets/img/Carousel2.png)

In the alternative design I changed the job specification section to a carousel because otherwise there would need to be multiple different pages if there were more then one job available, this helps the code be more maintainable by reducing the amount of code.

## Testing

### Functionality & Compatibility Testing

To test my website I will make sure all my links, buttons and interactive features work. To do this once I will go through and check all links, buttons and interactive features and record the results.

### Functionality & Compatibility Testing Results

### Usability Testing

To test this I let peers and family to look at the website to provide feedback.

#### Mitchell Aldrich

"The overall layout and design of the website is great and seems very professional and organized. However, one improvement I picked out is to edit the headers of the different positions in the job specifications to make them more noticeable since at first I didn't notice they were there".

#### Ugnius Meildazys

"The websites color scheme is nice and easy on the eyes but there is a few problems, first the carousel of the current staff seem to break when you use it for the first time after that it fixes itself. The job specification page works fine but there is a few things that would bug people, first would be the ability to only go forward and not back on the different jobs and one of the three job specifications is a different size and it messes with the size of the page making it jump, second would be the videos there is three of the same videos maybe have 3 different ones instead of all of them the same. The apply page has no place to upload a cv or any file and the gender select is hard to see when you hover your mouse over it."
